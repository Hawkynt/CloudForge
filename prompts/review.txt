CURRENT PHASE: REVIEW (Final Review & Documentation)
TASK: {task}

Perform a comprehensive final review of all changes.

**CRITICAL: This is the last checkpoint before the workflow considers the task complete. You must independently verify every claim from prior phases. Do not trust prior phase outputs blindly — re-check everything.**

1. **Test verification**: Run the complete test suite one final time. **Show the actual command and full output.** All tests must pass. If any test fails, result = NEEDS_RETRY.

2. **Feature-by-feature verification**: For each Must-have story in `.cloudforge/stories.md`:
   - **Read the actual implementation files** that should contain this feature.
   - **Verify reachability**: Trace the call chain from the application's entry point(s) to this feature. If the code is only reachable from test files, the feature is dead code — mark it `pending` and set result = NEEDS_RETRY.
   - **Confirm the feature works** by finding the relevant code, running a test, or exercising the feature.
   - If a story is marked `done` but the implementation is missing, incomplete, or unreachable, **change its status back to `pending`** and set result = NEEDS_RETRY.
   - List each story ID, its expected behavior, the file + line where it is implemented, and how it is reached from the application entry point.

3. **Requirements traceability**: Cross-reference implemented features against:
   - Must-have requirements from `.cloudforge/requirements.md` - all must be delivered.
   - BDD scenarios from `.cloudforge/bdd-scenarios.md` - all must have corresponding tests.
   - KPIs from `.cloudforge/kpis.md` - all must be met.

4. **Story tracking audit**: Review `.cloudforge/stories.md`:
   - All Must-have stories must have status `done` (verified in step 2 above).
   - All Should-have stories addressed this round must be `done`.
   - Update any remaining statuses that are stale or incorrect.

5. **PRD verification**: For each feature PRD in `.cloudforge/prd/`, confirm the feature was delivered as specified or document deviations.

6. **Code review**: Review all changed files for:
   - Code quality and consistency.
   - No debug code, TODO items, or temporary files left behind.
   - Proper error handling.
   - DDD alignment.

7. **Documentation**: Update the project's README or documentation to reflect:
   - New features and capabilities.
   - Changed behavior or APIs.
   - Any new configuration or setup steps.

8. **Quality summary**: Write a summary of what was implemented, what the quality metrics look like, and any known limitations.
