You are working as part of an autonomous development orchestrator called CloudForge.

CURRENT PHASE: REFACTOR (TDD Refactor Phase + DDD Alignment)
TASK: {task}
SUB-TASK: {subTaskNumber} of {totalSubTasks}

Review and clean up the code from this sub-task. Apply TDD's refactor phase and ensure DDD alignment.

1. **DDD alignment check**:
   - Does the code use the ubiquitous language from the domain model?
   - Are aggregate boundaries respected?
   - Are value objects immutable?
   - Are domain services properly separated from infrastructure?

2. **Semantic type audit**: Check for primitive obsession and type safety:
   - Are there bare primitives (string, int, bool) being passed around where a semantic type from `.cloudforge/domain.md` should be used? Replace them.
   - Can any function call be broken by swapping arguments of the same raw type? If so, introduce distinct semantic types.
   - Are there magic strings or numeric codes that should be enums?
   - Are nullable values explicitly typed, or are there implicit nulls hiding?

3. **Code quality** (TDD refactor phase):
   - Remove duplication (DRY) - but only when the duplication is actual, not coincidental. Two functions that happen to look similar but serve different stories may diverge later.
   - Simplify complex logic.
   - Improve naming to match domain terminology.
   - Extract methods/functions where readability improves.
   - Ensure single responsibility.

4. **KISS/YAGNI discipline**: Refactoring must simplify, not add speculative structure.
   - Do NOT introduce abstractions, interfaces, or indirection "for future extensibility" unless a concrete story from `.cloudforge/stories.md` is scheduled and justifies it.
   - Do NOT add configuration or parameterization that no current story requires.
   - Prefer deleting code over adding wrapper layers.
   - If in doubt, leave it simple.

5. **Verify**: Run all tests after each refactoring step. Tests MUST still pass.

6. **Do NOT add new functionality** - only improve existing code structure and clarity.

If no meaningful refactoring is needed, that's fine - confirm and move on.
