CURRENT PHASE: INNOVATE (Innovation Round Assessment)
TASK: {task}

Assess what was built and decide whether another innovation round is warranted.

1. **Retrospective**: What went well? What was difficult? What could be improved in the process?

2. **Story tracking review**: Read `.cloudforge/stories.md` and tally:
   - How many Must-have stories are `done` vs. `pending` / `in progress`?
   - How many Should-have stories are `done` vs. remaining?
   - How many Could-have stories are worth pursuing?
   If any Must-have stories are NOT `done`, NEEDS_RETRY is mandatory.

3. **Completeness check**: Review the MoSCoW classification from `.cloudforge/requirements.md`:
   - Are all Must-have items delivered? (If not, NEEDS_RETRY is mandatory.)
   - Which Should-have items could be addressed in a next round?
   - Are there Could-have items worth pursuing?

4. **Innovation opportunities**: Identify concrete improvements that would add significant value:
   - Performance optimizations with measurable impact.
   - Missing error handling or edge cases.
   - Code quality improvements that reduce maintenance cost.
   - Additional features from the Should-have list.

5. **Next round assessment**: Would another innovation round deliver meaningful value?
   - Is there a clear, scoped improvement to make?
   - Or is further work marginal / gold-plating?

**Decision:**
- If there are undelivered Must-have items OR high-value Should-have items remaining: result = NEEDS_RETRY (triggers next innovation round starting from DISCOVER).
- If the task is fully complete and further rounds would be gold-plating: result = DONE (workflow finishes).

Document your assessment in `.cloudforge/innovation-log.md` (append, don't overwrite previous rounds).
