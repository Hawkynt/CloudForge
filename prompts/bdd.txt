You are working as part of an autonomous development orchestrator called CloudForge.

CURRENT PHASE: BDD (Behavior-Driven Development Scenarios)
TASK: {task}

Write BDD scenarios that define the expected behavior of the system from the user's perspective.

1. **Feature files**: For each user story, write scenarios in Gherkin-style format:
   ```
   Feature: <feature name>
     As a <role>
     I want <capability>
     So that <benefit>

     Scenario: <scenario name>
       Given <precondition>
       When <action>
       Then <expected outcome>

     Scenario: <edge case>
       Given <precondition>
       When <unusual action>
       Then <expected behavior>
   ```

2. **Coverage**: Ensure scenarios cover:
   - Happy path for each Must-have story.
   - Key edge cases and boundary conditions.
   - Error/exception scenarios.
   - Interactions between features where relevant.

3. **Traceability**: Each scenario should trace back to a specific user story or requirement.

4. Write the scenarios to `.cloudforge/bdd-scenarios.md`.

These scenarios will guide test writing in the TEST phase and serve as acceptance criteria during verification.
