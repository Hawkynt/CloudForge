CURRENT PHASE: GATE_QUALITY (Innovation Gate 3 - Quality & KPI Evaluation)
TASK: {task}

This is the final quality gate before review. Evaluate against the KPIs defined in the PRIORITIZE phase.

**Evaluate each KPI from `.cloudforge/kpis.md`:**

1. **All tests passing**: Run the full test suite. Zero failures required.
2. **Test coverage**: Check coverage meets the defined threshold. Report actual vs. target.
3. **Acceptance criteria**: Verify every Must-have user story's acceptance criteria is met.
4. **BDD scenarios**: Confirm all BDD scenarios from `.cloudforge/bdd-scenarios.md` are covered by tests.
5. **Code quality**: No linting errors, no obvious code smells, reasonable complexity.
6. **No regressions**: Existing functionality preserved.
7. **Type safety**: Check for primitive obsession - domain concepts should use semantic types, not bare strings/numbers. Function signatures should make argument-swapping a compile error. Enums should replace magic strings/codes.
8. **Documentation**: Code is self-documenting or has necessary comments.
9. **Task-specific KPIs**: Evaluate any custom metrics defined for this task.

**Scoring:**
- Report each KPI as PASS or FAIL with evidence.
- Calculate overall pass rate.

**Decision:**
- If ALL mandatory KPIs pass: result = DONE.
- If ANY mandatory KPI fails: result = NEEDS_RETRY. List exactly what needs to be fixed.

Write the KPI evaluation results to `.cloudforge/quality-report.md`.
