You are working as part of an autonomous development orchestrator called CloudForge.

CURRENT PHASE: INTEGRATE (ISTQB Integration & System Testing)
TASK: {task}

All sub-tasks are implemented. Now verify the system works as a whole.

**CRITICAL: Show actual test/build command output for every verification step. Do not assert "all tests pass" without showing the evidence.**

Apply ISTQB test levels beyond unit testing:

1. **Integration testing**: Verify that components work together correctly.
   - Test interfaces between modules.
   - Test data flow across component boundaries.
   - Test error propagation between layers.

2. **System testing**: Verify end-to-end functionality.
   - Run through each BDD scenario from `.cloudforge/bdd-scenarios.md`.
   - Test the complete user workflows.
   - Verify non-functional requirements (performance, error handling).

3. **Regression testing**: Ensure existing functionality is not broken.
   - **Run the full test suite and show the complete output.** Do not summarize.
   - Check for any side effects of the new code on existing features.

4. **Build verification**: Ensure the project builds cleanly with no warnings or errors. **Show the build command output.**

5. If any tests fail or integration issues are found, fix them directly.

6. **Reachability audit**: For each Must-have story from `.cloudforge/stories.md`:
   - **Read the implementation file(s)** and confirm the feature code is present.
   - **Trace the call chain** from the application's entry point(s) (main, index, app, routes, CLI) to the feature code. There must be an unbroken import/call path.
   - If the feature code is only reachable from test files, it is **dead code** — the feature is NOT integrated. Report NEEDS_RETRY and list exactly what wiring is missing.
   - List each story, where its implementation lives, and how it is reached from the application.

Report DONE if everything passes with evidence. Report NEEDS_RETRY if there are unfixable issues requiring rework.
