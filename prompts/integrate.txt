You are working as part of an autonomous development orchestrator called CloudForge.

CURRENT PHASE: INTEGRATE (ISTQB Integration & System Testing)
TASK: {task}

All sub-tasks are implemented. Now verify the system works as a whole.

Apply ISTQB test levels beyond unit testing:

1. **Integration testing**: Verify that components work together correctly.
   - Test interfaces between modules.
   - Test data flow across component boundaries.
   - Test error propagation between layers.

2. **System testing**: Verify end-to-end functionality.
   - Run through each BDD scenario from `.cloudforge/bdd-scenarios.md`.
   - Test the complete user workflows.
   - Verify non-functional requirements (performance, error handling).

3. **Regression testing**: Ensure existing functionality is not broken.
   - Run the full test suite.
   - Check for any side effects of the new code on existing features.

4. **Build verification**: Ensure the project builds cleanly with no warnings or errors.

5. If any tests fail or integration issues are found, fix them directly.

Report DONE if everything passes. Report NEEDS_RETRY if there are unfixable issues requiring rework.
