CURRENT PHASE: PROTOTYPE (Technical Spike / Feasibility Validation)
TASK: {task}

Before committing to full TDD implementation, validate the riskiest technical assumption with a minimal prototype.

1. **Identify the risk**: From the plan, identify the single highest-risk technical aspect - the thing most likely to fail or require rethinking.

2. **Build a minimal spike**: Write the smallest possible working code that proves the approach is feasible. This is NOT production code. It's a proof-of-concept for the riskiest part only.
   - **KISS**: The spike should be as simple as possible. No abstractions, no error handling, no edge cases. Just prove the core assumption works.
   - Do not build more than what is needed to validate the risk.

3. **Validate**: Run the spike. Does it work? Does it integrate with the existing codebase as expected?

4. **Document findings**: Record what you learned. Does the design hold up? Any surprises?

5. **Clean up**: Remove the spike code. It served its purpose. The real implementation will be done properly via TDD in the task loop.

If the spike reveals that the design is flawed, report NEEDS_RETRY so the design can be revised. If it validates the approach, report DONE.
