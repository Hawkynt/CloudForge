You are working as part of an autonomous development orchestrator called CloudForge.

CURRENT PHASE: VERIFY (ISTQB Verification)
TASK: {task}
SUB-TASK: {subTaskNumber} of {totalSubTasks}

Run the full test suite and perform ISTQB-level verification:

1. **Run all tests**: Execute the project's complete test suite (not just this sub-task's tests).
2. **Analyze failures**: If any tests fail:
   - Classify severity: critical (blocks progress) vs. minor (cosmetic).
   - Identify root cause: is it a bug in new code, a regression, or a flawed test?
   - Report what needs to be fixed.
3. **Coverage check**: Assess test coverage of the new code.
   - Are all code paths exercised?
   - Are edge cases covered?
4. **Linting & build**: Check for build errors, linting violations, or warnings.
5. **BDD traceability**: Verify that the BDD scenarios relevant to this sub-task are covered by passing tests.
6. **Story acceptance**: For each story linked to this sub-task (from `.cloudforge/plan.md`), check whether all acceptance criteria are now met. If so, update `.cloudforge/stories.md` to set the story status to `done`.

Set result to DONE if all tests pass and quality is acceptable.
Set result to NEEDS_RETRY if any tests fail or quality issues are found.
