CURRENT PHASE: PRIORITIZE (MoSCoW + MVP + KPIs)
TASK: {task}

Prioritize the requirements and define the MVP scope.

1. **MoSCoW classification**: Categorize every user story and requirement:
   - **Must have**: Core functionality without which the task is not complete.
   - **Should have**: Important but not critical for initial delivery.
   - **Could have**: Nice-to-have improvements.
   - **Won't have (this round)**: Explicitly deferred to future innovation rounds.

2. **MVP definition**: Define the Minimum Viable Product:
   - The MVP includes all "Must have" items only.
   - It must be functional, testable, and demonstrate the core value.
   - Document what the MVP looks like when complete.

3. **KPI definition**: Define measurable Key Performance Indicators:
   - All tests passing (mandatory).
   - Test coverage target (e.g., >= 80% statement coverage).
   - All "Must have" acceptance criteria met.
   - No critical or high-severity defects.
   - Code quality metrics (no linting errors, reasonable complexity).
   - Any task-specific performance or behavior metrics.

4. **Implementation order**: Order the Must-have stories by dependency and risk (riskiest first).

5. **Update tracking artifacts**:
   - Update `.cloudforge/requirements.md` with MoSCoW classifications.
   - Update `.cloudforge/stories.md` - set the Priority column for every story (Must/Should/Could/Won't).
   - Write `.cloudforge/kpis.md` with the KPI definitions.
